<blockquote>
  <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;Growing up my mom always played eighties rock, and my dad favored sixties and seventies classic rock. I continued listening to this growing up and found a liking in metal and grunge as well. I have always been passionate about music, specifically anything with a guitar, ranging from reggae to rock and roll as well as classic county. Guitarists Jimi Hendrix and Dicky Betts are my main influences on style and preferred music. I have spent countless hours watching concert films and videos in attempt to learn and appreciate technique. In my opinion, these are two of the best guitarists of all time. In my playing I try to master the sound they gave to the world, and I am always humbled in doing so. I have a great respect for the founders of the rock music that myself and so many others still listen to today.</p>
